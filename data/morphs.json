Ariel morphs have exotic-looking heads similar to those of hulder morphs, but they also possess sleek and streamlined humanoid bodies with four limbs and a pair of bat-like wings.

    "description": "This sleeve hands tyrants the tools to ensure loyalty - or at least obedience - from their citizens. Based on simple splicers, freeman morphs are genetically and psychosurgically modified to be receptive to authority while weakening willpower and \"dissident\" traits. They are also genetically modified with a protein that makes their neurons sensitive to light. When combined with an optogenetics module, these neurons can be activated and deactivated remotely, enabling a monitoring muse or meshed overseer to control the ego's behavior. Freeman morphs typically carry a monitor ALI (often a modified fork of the dictator's muse) that watches over the ego, reports suspicious activity, and can seize physical control in an emergency. In some regimes, citizens are not informed of these implants, enabling the AIs to spy and snitch in secret. These \"slave morphs\" are decried or outlawed as coercive in many polities, though they are secretly deployed in remote corporate and authoritarian habitats. Surprisingly, some people voluntarily sleeve freeman morphs, preferring to hand responsibility and decision-making over to other parties, such as the Sendero Luminoso Benevolent Dictatorship habitat in the Neptunian Trojans.",

Suryas blur the line between biomorph and synthmorph and push the envelope of synthetic biology in order to survive in this hostile environment. Named for a Hindu sun deity, suryas reach lengths of ten meters or more and rely heavily on both whale and extremophile genetics. Their skin is a metamaterial that provides an almost perfect reflection of the sun's spectral output and enables radiative cooling. They \"surf \" the solar winds using powerful magnetic fields that also shield from radiation, plasma, and heat. Strong bones and connective tissues protect against the crushing solar gravity while medichines repair tissue damaged by radiation and convert hydrogen ions into water. Surya rely on lasers and chromatophore signaling using wavelengths not flooded by the sun's emissions to communicate. A lateral line organ allows them to \"hear\" the low-frequency vibrations that resonate through the corona's plasma, which is both useful for limited \"whale song\" short-range communication and helpful for predicting and avoiding flares and other solar weather.",

Ripwings take advantage of the _chiroptera_ genestock used to give the first avian uplifts functional hands. Instead of feathers, they feature tough leathery skin or even scales.

    "description": "Designed by autonomist xenobotanists, these pods are bio-engineered from the predatory whiplash creatures found on the exoplanet Sunrise, with additional transgenic features. The primary modification made to the original creature was to turn the entire organism upside down and orient the digestive portion of the organism horizontally, so that the whiplash's tri-lobed orifice faces forward. The whiplash's grasping roots were also converted into even more motile \"walking tentacles.\" Other adjustments include the addition of a pair of grasping limbs, each with four universally opposable digits; artificial sensing mods (providing transhuman-standard sensing ability); and a general toughening of the internal structure for rigidity and support. The ability to extend and retract the whiplash's feeding tendril was heavily enhanced, so now the tendril acts more like a two-meter-long chameleon-like tongue than a hanging food-trap. Although whiplash morphs are unusual even by transhuman standards, they are gaining traction among gatecrashers working in arboreal environments.",

They are often equipped with hacking tools and other subversive ware, from graffiti implements and mounted sprayers to nanoswarm hives or even explosives, according to their specific purpose. Most importantly, they are built without cortical stacks, so if they are destroyed, the ego cannot be interrogated through psychosurgery. Griefers are illegal in many habitats, especially in the Planetary Consortium, but DRM-free blueprints are easy to find in many darknets, thus making them a persistent annoyance across the Solar System. A few habitats have passed laws mandating that destroying a griefer is not considered murder, assault, or even destruction of property.",

For exceptionally difficult terrain, the wheels can be retracted and the xu fu can maneuver as a walker. In addition to two standard arms, it features a lower third arm for collecting samples and an upper telescoping fourth arm for reaching far distances and overseeing obstacles. All arms are retractable. Xu fus have an impressive sensor package and are ideal for surface-based scouting, investigating tunnels, and other gatecrashing tasks.",
